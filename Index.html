            </div>

            <h1>Section 1: Introduction & Core Principles</h1>
            
            <h2>1.1 Welcome to Top 100: Purpose of the Rulebook</h2>
            <p>Top 100 is a custom Soccer Manager Worlds game world, established to bring together dedicated and active managers in a highly competitive environment. This document serves as the official and consolidated rulebook for all participating managers. Its primary purpose is to provide a single, clear, and comprehensive set of regulations governing all aspects of gameplay and conduct within the Top 100 community.</p>
            
            <p>These rules are meticulously designed to ensure fair play, maintain competitive balance, and foster an enjoyable, engaging experience for every manager. Adherence to these rules is paramount for the integrity and continued success of the Top 100 game world.</p>
            
            <p>The regulations herein cover:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Squad management</li>
                <li>Transfers</li>
                <li>Competitions</li>
                <li>Conduct</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>All with specific sanctions for breaches, aimed at upholding the principle of fair play and preventing any form of manipulation for personal gain.</p>

            <h2>1.2 Guiding Principles: Fair Play, Respect, and Community</h2>
            <p>The Top 100 game world is built upon a foundation of core values:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fair Play:</strong> This is the cornerstone of Top 100. It encompasses strict adherence to all rules outlined in this document, a commitment to competing honestly, and a refusal to exploit any game mechanics or loopholes for an unfair advantage.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect:</strong> All managers are expected to treat fellow participants, including opponents and the administrative team (Top 100 FA), with courtesy and respect in all interactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Community:</strong> Top 100 thrives on active participation and positive engagement through various communication channels including the newsfeed, blog, Facebook group, WhatsApp group chat, and Discord server.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>1.3 Top 100 Administration (FA & All-Manager Polls)</h2>
            <p>The governance of the Top 100 game world is managed by two key bodies:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Top 100 Football Association (FA):</strong> The Admin Team, composed of five experienced Top 100 managers: David M, Chris M, Regan, Hugo, and Bojan. Their primary responsibility is to ensure the game world operates fairly according to these rules.</li>
                <li><strong>Top 100 All-Manager Polls:</strong> All Top 100 managers are entitled and encouraged to deliberate and vote on proposed new rules, changes to existing rules, and other significant issues.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Section 2: Managerial Conduct & Responsibilities</h1>
            
            <h2>2.1 General Expectations (Activity, Communication)</h2>
            <p>Active participation and clear communication are fundamental to the smooth operation and enjoyment of the Top 100 game world. Managers are expected to:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maintain Activity Levels:</strong> Regularly log in to the Soccer Manager Worlds platform, manage their teams effectively, and ensure timely participation in all scheduled league and cup fixtures.</li>
                <li><strong>Engage in Communication:</strong> Be responsive on official Top 100 communication channels, particularly for transfer negotiations and fixture arrangements.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2.2 Manager Contracts & Objectives</h2>
            <div class="rule-highlight">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Formal Manager Contracts with predefined targets are no longer in effect. However, general performance expectations still apply, and consistent underperformance can lead to manager sackings as detailed in Section 6.3.</p>
            </div>

            <h1>Section 3: Squad Management</h1>
            
            <h2>3.1 Squad Size Limits (Player Cap)</h2>
            <p>To ensure competitive balance and prevent the hoarding of players, a strict squad size limit is enforced:</p>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <ul>
                    <li>Managers may have a <strong>maximum of 50 players</strong> in their squad at any given time</li>
                    <li>This limit is strictly enforced</li>
                    <li>Exceeding the 50-player cap will result in a transfer ban</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>3.2 Player Loans (In and Out, Squad Cap Implications) - UPDATED</h2>
            <div class="updated-text">
                <p><strong>CORRECTED RULE:</strong> Player loans are permitted within Top 100, subject to the following conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All loan transfers are generally allowed</li>
                    <li><strong>Squad Cap:</strong> Players currently registered to a manager's squad, <strong>including BOTH players on loan TO that club AND players loaned OUT from that club</strong>, count towards the 50-player squad limit</li>
                    <li><strong>Youth Cup Exception:</strong> No loans are permitted at all in the Youth Cup</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Clarification:</strong> ALL loan players count towards your 50-player squad cap, regardless of direction.</p>
