                    <h2>1.1 Welcome to Top 100: Purpose of the Rulebook</h2>
                    <p>Top 100 is a custom Soccer Manager Worlds game world, established to bring together dedicated and active managers in a highly competitive environment.

                    <p>The regulations herein cover:</p>
                    <ul>

                    </ul>

                    <h2>1.2 Guiding Principles: Fair Play, Respect, and Community</h2>
                    <p>The Top 100 game world is built upon a foundation of core values that extend beyond the digital pitch:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Fair Play</h3>
                    <p>This is the cornerstone of Top 100. It encompasses strict adherence to all rules outlined in this document, a commitment to competing honestly, and a refusal to exploit any game mechanics or loopholes for an unfair advantage.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Respect</h3>
                    <p>All managers are expected to treat fellow participants, including opponents and the administrative team (Top 100 FA), with courtesy and respect in all interactions.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Community</h3>
                    <p>Top 100 thrives on active participation and positive engagement. Managers are encouraged to be active on the newsfeed, blog, and various communication channels such as the Facebook group, WhatsApp group chat, and Discord server.</p>

                    <h2>1.3 Top 100 Administration (FA & All-Manager Polls)</h2>
                    <p>The governance of the Top 100 game world is managed by two key bodies:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Top 100 Football Association (FA)</h3>
                    <p>This is the Admin Team, composed of five experienced Top 100 managers: David M, Chris M, Gyan, Hugo, and Bojan. The Top 100 FA is entrusted with providing advice and guidance on all Top 100 issues.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Top 100 All-Manager Polls</h3>
                    <p>All Top 100 managers are entitled and encouraged to deliberate and vote on proposed new rules, changes to existing rules, and any other significant issues that the administration or the community chooses to bring forward.</p>

                    <h1>Section 2: Managerial Conduct & Responsibilities</h1>
                    
                    <h2>2.1 General Expectations (Activity, Communication)</h2>
                    <p>Active participation and clear communication are fundamental to the smooth operation and enjoyment of the Top 100 game world. Managers are expected to:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Maintain Activity Levels</h3>
                    <p>Regularly log in to the Soccer Manager Worlds platform, manage their teams effectively, and ensure timely participation in all scheduled league and cup fixtures. Consistent inactivity may have repercussions, as outlined in the rules for manager sackings.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Engage in Communication</h3>
                    <p>Be responsive on official Top 100 communication channels, including the in-game newsfeed, private messages, the official blog, and associated social media groups. This is particularly crucial for the timely negotiation and agreement of transfer deals and the arrangement of friendly matches for cup competitions.</p>

                    <h2>2.2 Manager Contracts & Objectives</h2>
                    <p>Rules on formal manager contracts with predefined targets have evolved.</p>
                    <p><strong>Formal Manager Contracts</strong>, which previously involved new managers agreeing to a specific contract length and performance targets, are <strong>no longer in effect</strong>. The system where unsuccessful managers were explicitly expected to resign based on these contract terms has been discontinued.</p>
                    <p>However, it is crucial to understand that general performance expectations still apply, and consistent underperformance can lead to manager sackings as detailed in Section 6.3.</p>

                    <h1>Section 3: Squad Management</h1>
                    
                    <h2>3.1 Squad Size Limits (Player Cap)</h2>
                    <p>To ensure competitive balance and prevent the hoarding of players, a strict squad size limit is enforced:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Managers may have a <strong>maximum of 50 players</strong> in their squad at any given time.</li>
                        <li>This limit is <strong>strictly enforced</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Exceeding the 50-player cap will result in a <strong>transfer ban</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The consistent reiteration of this rule and its associated penalty across multiple rule documents highlights its critical importance to the game world's economy and competitive integrity. This hard cap forces managers into active squad management and strategic decision-making regarding player retention, sales, and loans, thereby promoting a more dynamic player market.</p>

                        <h4>3.2 Player Loans (In and Out, Squad Cap Implications) - CORRECTED</h4>
                        <p>Player loans are permitted within Top 100, subject to the following conditions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>All loan transfers are generally allowed.</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Squad Cap:</strong> <strong>ALL</strong> players currently registered to a manager's squad count towards the 50-player squad limit. This includes:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Players currently at your club</li>

                            <li><strong>Youth Cup Exception:</strong> A specific restriction applies to the Youth Cup, where no loans are permitted at all.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Previous Rule (INCORRECT):</strong> "Players loaned <em>out</em> by a manager to another club within Top 100 do not count against the loaning manager's 50-player limit"</p>
                        <p><strong>Corrected Rule:</strong> ALL players under a manager's registration count towards their squad limit, maintaining competitive balance and preventing circumvention of the 50-player cap through loan arrangements.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Top 100 Regen will generate most, if not all, new managers entering Top 100</li>
                            <li>This replaces previous feeder league arrangements</li>
                            <li>New managers should join Top 100 Regen to demonstrate their commitment and ability before being considered for Top 100 clubs</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><em>Note: Top 120 is no longer a feeder or waiting room game world for Top 100 (as of 20 August 2025).</em></p>

                    <h2>8.1 Process for Rule Changes</h2>
                    <p>The rules of the Top 100 game world are not static and can be amended through a participatory process:</p>
                    <p>The <strong>Top 100 All-Manager Polls</strong>, which consists of all Top 100 managers deliberating and voting on proposed new rules or any changes to existing rules.</p>
                    <p>This democratic approach to rule amendments ensures that the managerial community has a voice in shaping the regulations that govern their gameplay, fostering a sense of shared ownership and understanding.</p>

                    <h2>8.2 Contacting Administration for Clarification</h2>
                    <p>If a manager is unsure about the interpretation of a rule or requires clarification on any aspect of the Top 100 game world, they should seek guidance from the administration:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <strong>Top 100 FA (Admin Team)</strong> is responsible for providing advice and guidance on all Top 100 issues</li>
                        <li>For specific objections or queries related to Top 100 transfer rules, managers should direct their communication via Private Message to the designated admin, <strong>David Marsden</strong></li>
